# The Test

Using the random user API ([https://randomuser.me/documentation](https://randomuser.me/documentation)) â€“ create a React app that has a user search that allows for searching by email and last name.

User results should come back similar to Slack's @mention functionality (but not using @mention, just a general search)

## Running the app

- Clone this repo into a local folder.
- Verify that you're running Node ^12.8.0.
- From the local folder, just run `yarn start` or `yarn dev` and the server will fire up.
- Have fun.
